This code uses a LSTM neural network to predict stock prices. It loads historical stock price data for a specific company, preprocesses
the data, trains the LSTM model, and then uses the trained model to make predictions on test data. Finally, it plots the predicted prices
against the actual prices and outputs the predicted prices for the next 5 days. 

To use this code, you need to have historical stock price data in a CSV file, and you need to change the "company" variable to match the company whose stock
prices you are trying to predict. You can also change the number of days used for prediction by modifying the "prediction_days" variable.
